## 🎯 How to Use (Step-by-Step)

### 🔹 Step 1: Fill Page 1 (Personal Info)
- Navigate to **Page 1** of the subscriber form in CRM
- Click the **"Page 1"** button in the extension popup  
  → Auto-fills name, ID, address, next-of-kin, and sets location to **Boosaaso (Bari)**  
  → Automatically clicks **"Next"**

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure Services (Page 2)
- On **Page 2**, click the **"Page 2"** button  
  → Checks "Prepaid"  
  → Attaches "Base Plan"  
  → Picks an unused MSISDN (phone number)  
  → Asks you to enter **7-digit ICCID suffix** (e.g., `1234567`)  
  → Logs the activation securely

> 💡 You’ll get a prompt: *"Enter ICCID suffix (7 digits)"* — type only the last 7 digits of the SIM’s ICCID.

### 🔹 Step 3: Activate Subscriber
- After Page 2 completes, click **"Next & Activate"**  
  → Completes checkout  
  → Searches for the subscriber  
  → Clicks **Activate**  
  → Shows success/failure message

### 🔹 Step 4: Handle Errors (If Needed)
- If ICCID wasn’t accepted, click **"Retry ICCID"**  
  → Re-enter the 7 digits  
  → System safely retries without losing your data
